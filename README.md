# I. Adding the domoticz layer to your build

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the domoticz layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the domoticz layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

Add this in 'bblayers.conf' :
```
  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-domoticz \
    "
```

Add this in the 'local.conf' file :

```
# Add the domoticz to the final generated image :
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " domoticz"

```
